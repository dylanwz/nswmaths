Each Question can have multiple categories assigned (Thats why theres the QuestionCategory cross table - One to Many)
Each Question *can* belong to an Official Paper (if not than ringo made it lol so OriginID can be 0 or smth)

Users can generate papers
-> Paper is given an ID under GeneratedPapers Table
-> Each question is assigned to the paper by REFERENCE (so it can update in the future) in the GeneratedPapersCross table

Subscriptions table has information about the subscriptions available
UserSubscriptions is the user's actual current and past subscription
